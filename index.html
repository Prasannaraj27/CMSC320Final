    <h1>How do factors such as Crime, Income and Weather determine an area's population?</h1>

      By creating this project, we wanted to gain some insight regarding the factors that contribute to where people decide to live. These factors could include components such as income, crime rate, weather, proximity, and employment rate. Also, we were curious if these factors are correlated to one another as well as the connections that can be made based on the various data observed.

    <p>
      This project analyzes public data to help answer that question using three key metrics: income, crime, and weather. By curating, cleaning, and visualizing real-world datasets, and using machine learning (KMeans clustering), we aim to group regions by quality-of-life metrics and identify optimal districts for a user with preferences such as high income, low crime, and warm weather. This can help individuals gain insight regarding the best places to live.
