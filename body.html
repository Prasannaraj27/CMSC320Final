  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Worked on city level crime data focusing more on overall crime rates and making connections to different crime-related metrics such as safest areas, correlation between different crime types, and the trends in overall crime data for these areas.

    This project analyzes public data to help answer that question using three key metrics: income, crime, and weather. By curating, cleaning, and visualizing real-world datasets, and using machine learning (KMeans clustering), we aim to group regions by quality-of-life metrics and identify optimal districts for a user with preferences such as high income, low crime, and warm weather. This can help individuals gain insight regarding the best places to live.
